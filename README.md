This is an Android library that supports showing an overlay action button on top of other apps or even the Android home screen. It includes an integrated settings dialog so end users can adjust the size and other options for the overlay. 

A service is required to keep the overlay alive while it is shown over other apps. A demo of this service is also provided along with code to prompt for user permissions.
